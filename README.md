## EmpowHER
During FemmeHacks, an all-female collegiate hackathon held at University of Pennsylvania in February 2016, three other team members and I created an application focused on women.

Women face numerous challenges daily, including discrimination in the workplace. We wanted to create a way to give working women opportunities to share their experiences with other women.

EmpowHER is a web application. Users can write reviews about their employers and rate their work experiences such as work environment and co-worker attitudes. As personal narratives and storytelling is a valuable way of sharing personal experiences, users can read about how others approach actions driven by biases and prejudice.

### Future Plans:
Sign-in authentication from Facebookâ€™s API
Search within their industry fields and compare experiences
Connect with other women in their field with a messaging feature
