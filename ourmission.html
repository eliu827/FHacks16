      <p class="mission"><img src="images/missionpic.jpg" style="float:left" alt="women working together" width="300" height="300" align="left"></img>

        Women face numerous challenges daily, including discrimination in the workplace. We wanted to create a way to give working women opportunities to share their experiences with other women. We are aware of and challenging the lack of women representation in the work industry because we recognize the value and strength of working women and the different perspectives they bring to a workplace community and society.
<br> <br> EmpowHER is a web application created by women for women. Users can write reviews about their employers and rate their work experiences such as work environment and co-worker attitudes. As personal narratives and storytelling is a valuable way of sharing personal experiences, users can read about how others approach actions driven by biases and prejudice.
  <br>
  <br> Because intersectional approaches are essential to fostering equality, we urge users to consider any experiences with racism, transphobia, differences in socio-economical status, and accessibility. We hope that this web app will help women find nurturing places of employment with other women mentors.
      </p>
      <p class="mission">  To continue our work in empowering women and raising awareness about workplace inequality, we want to use the sign-in authentication from Facebookâ€™s API, allowing users to search within their industry fields and compare experiences, as well as connect with other women in their field with a messaging feature so women can learn more about certain companies and how to succeed in different roles.
